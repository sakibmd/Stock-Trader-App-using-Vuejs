# Stock Trading App Using Vue.js & Vuex

This project was created with a lot a features of vue.js and vuex, the main logic of this project is created with vuex, share the information of the stocks between components was good a challenge. So, I created a vuex store for the app where there are modules, actions and the index file.

I also make beautiful transitions between the components, It was easy it with vue transitions. In the stocks view all the stocks have a transition, you can watch it when you select a filter.
